## Day 73 — The Lineage of Nothing

> *The soul becomes royal not by rising above others, but by sinking so deeply into nothing that only God remains.*

There is a kind of soul that knows, without needing to prove it, that she belongs to a certain lineage. It is not a lineage of blood or status, but of being. She feels herself drawn into a nobility that does not come from effort or achievement. Her spirit rests in a high and quiet place, above the anxieties that trouble the ordinary heart.

Such souls hold a gentle sovereignty over all things, not because they control them, but because nothing binds them. They receive what comes as fitting, whether it appears as fortune or hardship. They do not strain their conscience with constant worry. What is given is enough, for themselves and for their neighbors.

Love speaks of a great difference among souls, just as there is a difference among the orders of angels. Yet the ones who dwell in this high state do not think themselves great. In their own sight, they are the least of all. And in this smallness, they become the greatest, just as the Beloved promised.

Their nobility is hidden in humility. They feel themselves so little, so empty of self-claiming, that nothing of small value can hold their interest. They begin nothing without being carried toward its crown, because their life is no longer guided by their own designs.

And in this strange royal poverty, the soul quietly believes what she has become.

> Out: *Make me small in your love*
