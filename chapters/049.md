## Day 49 — The Mountain Above the Wind

> *There is a place where nothing outside can shake what rests within.*

Love speaks of those who sit upon the mountain, above the reach of wind and rain. These souls are no longer moved by shame or praise, by fear or honor. What happens around them does not disturb their dwelling. Their gates stand open, and nothing inside can be harmed. No act of love is wasted there. This mountain is not a place of height over others, but a stillness beyond disturbance.

Reason worries for the old companions—Shame, Dread, and careful judgment. They once served faithfully, guarding the soul from harm. Will they now be cast out? Love answers gently. They are not dismissed. They remain, but only as porters at the gate. Their task is simple: to guard against anything that would turn the soul away from love. Beyond that, they have no authority. Inside the house, love alone governs.

Within this freedom, the soul becomes strangely naked. Not exposed, but freed from the coverings that once defined her. She is no longer confined to the weight of the body or the restless stirrings of desire. She dwells more truly in a sweet, unknown country than in the place she once called herself.

When asked what brings her the greatest gladness, Love answers for her: she has taken leave of Reason and the Virtues. Not in rejection, but in completion. A deeper writing has begun within her, traced not by human hands but by the Spirit itself. In this silent school, nothing is spoken, yet everything is known.
