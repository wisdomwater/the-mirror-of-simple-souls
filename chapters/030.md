## Day 30 — Refusing Every Lesser Gift

> *There comes a moment when the heart knows only one source of joy, and quietly lets all others fall away.*

This is the end of striving for peace, not because peace is grasped, but because it is no longer sought anywhere else. The soul finds itself taken—claimed by Love so completely that it cannot imagine receiving joy, glory, or fulfillment from any other hand. Even if all heaven were to offer its gifts through another, the soul would gently refuse. Not out of contempt for the gifts, but out of fidelity to the Giver.

Here, will loosens its grip. Desire no longer negotiates or compares. The soul belongs, and in belonging, it rests. There is a kind of holy embarrassment in this—an awe so tender it leaves the soul quiet, blushing before God, unsure how it ever thought to ask for anything at all. What could be said? Words stumble. The movements of the spirit are as uncountable as waves in a storm. The body, heavy and earthbound, cannot carry what the soul has touched.

And yet, even a few words are worth offering. Not because they capture the truth, but because silence has already done its work. The soul has been given vision—of God, of love, of all that flows from God—and this knowing overwhelms every former way of being. There is no special practice left to perform, no posture to maintain. The knowing comes and goes, as love moves, but it has made its home here.

What remains is a quiet inhabiting, open and undone, waiting without waiting.
