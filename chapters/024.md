## Day 24 — Drunk on What Cannot Be Drunk

> *The soul is intoxicated by a fullness it does not consume, yet somehow shares.*

Reason senses a paradox and leans closer: it seems greater to be drunk on what Love itself drinks than on what remains forever undrunk. Love agrees, and gently deepens the mystery. The soul has not taken the highest draught—no creature does—but it has it, because Love has it. Between Love and the soul there is no rift, no opposing current. What Love holds, the soul holds by union, not by grasping.

Imagine a great vessel of divine bounty, filled beyond measure, with many openings. The clearest, most brimming wine flows from the sovereign source, known only within the life of God. From this source, without drinking it, the soul becomes inebriated. Emptied and forgotten into freedom, the soul sways with a joy that exceeds experience. It is drunk not on what has been tasted, but on what is endlessly more than taste.

From here arises a peculiar freedom. The mind rests low, the will loosens, understanding grows subtle without strain. Desire no longer pulls the soul forward or back. Nothing is done that disturbs the quiet peace within. There is no craving to satisfy, no lack to correct. The soul remains clean in heart, not by vigilance, but by simplicity.

It knows the “more” without needing to know, and so it does not cling to the least. All things feel even, balanced, held. Whatever comes does not unseat it. The soul remains free because nothing is being demanded of it—not even itself.
