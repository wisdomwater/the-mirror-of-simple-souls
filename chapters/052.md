## Day 52 — Love Needs No Witness

> Love trusts without proof, for the Beloved is evidence enough.

When Reason asks where the soul turns, she answers simply: to the One who cannot die, whose truth cannot be captured in words or proven by examples. This knowing was placed in her before she had any proof, before she could argue or defend it. Love itself is the witness. To demand more would be to doubt the very One she loves.

Reason says there are two ways: the way of belief, and the way of love. The way of belief searches, asks, and gathers proofs. It wanders through hills and valleys, seeking God in places, practices, and outward forms. It labors and pleads, yet still feels the weight of distance.

But the soul who has passed through love seeks differently. She does not search here or there, in high places or low, in more or less. She finds God everywhere, because her will has been gently joined to his. Union has made all places one place.

When asked what she is, she can only say: “I am what I am by the grace of God.” She no longer sees herself as something separate. Wherever she looks, she finds only God. Truth does not merely surround her—it lives within her and fulfills all things there.

In this simplicity, the soul has nothing left to defend or explain. She rests, naked and quiet, in the One who is.
