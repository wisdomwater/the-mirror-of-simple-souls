## Day 39 — Sitting in the Seat of Peace

> *True freedom does not move toward anything; it rests where it is placed.*

The soul has come to a stillness that does not need to assert itself. She sits without striving, settled in peace, alive in good conscience, free in perfect charity. Nothing needs to be arranged. Nothing needs to be secured. This freedom is quiet and complete.

Love says she wills nothing now, because willing—even good willing—can still bind a soul to itself. When the inward will insists on shaping outcomes, even for holy reasons, it keeps a subtle hold. Such a soul may desire that God fulfill its desires, and in this, it remains a servant of its own movement. But the soul who has been freed does not even want that. She wants only that God’s will be done—wherever, however, in herself and in all others.

Those who work by their own willing are not condemned; they are simply not yet free. They take pleasure in their good intentions and believe there is nothing better. Reason and Dread quietly nourish this will, and so fulfillment never quite arrives. There is always more effort, more fear, more desire.

But the soul led by Faith and Love rests from all this. She is no longer pulled by fear of loss or hope of reward. Hell and heaven no longer weigh on her choosing. She neither wants nor resists what comes.

Love dares to say it plainly: not-willing in God is worth more than the most heroic well-willing for God. Even the greatest deeds fade beside this simple dependence.

Something remains here—unimpressed, unafraid, resting still deeper.
