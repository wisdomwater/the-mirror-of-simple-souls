## Day 66 — Where the Will Comes to Rest

> The soul finds peace when her will is planted so deeply in Love that she no longer reaches for herself.

There is a freedom that comes when the soul no longer lives as a servant, bargaining or striving. Love lifts her beyond that life. She is no longer anxious for gain, no longer afraid of loss. Desire softens, fear loosens its grip, and the heart turns toward one thing only: Love itself.

Such a soul is not held together by effort. She is upheld by Love, spread over and through with it, as though wrapped in a gentle sea. Even suffering cannot break this bond, for her heart has been given away. She no longer lives for herself.

Her will, once scattered among many wants, has now been planted deeply in the life of the Trinity. There it rests, rooted in the One who first gave it. To sin, she would have to pull her will out of that ground, but she does not wish to. She leaves it there freely, not because she must, but because it is good, and because Love wills it so.

Until the soul lets go of her own will completely, her peace remains uncertain. But when she releases it, she becomes like one gently intoxicated with divine joy—no longer trembling before what may come.

She begins to live without clutching at what she gives, receives, or holds. And in this strange freedom, she finds herself carried into a quiet sovereignty, where nothing need be defended, and nothing need be claimed.
