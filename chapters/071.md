## Day 71 — Paradise Without Distance

> *Paradise is not a place we travel to, but the simple seeing of God when nothing stands between.*

Love says that the soul who has come to peace does not live as a beggar among creatures. She rests alone in the glory that is God’s own life, for paradise is nothing other than God Himself. There is no separate country, no distant realm. Paradise is the nearness of the Beloved, felt without barrier or demand.

So the thief entered paradise the very day he died, though Christ had not yet ascended into heaven. This is not a puzzle when you understand what paradise truly is. The thief saw God, and that vision was paradise. To see God is to be there already.

The soul may taste this even while she still walks in the body. Outwardly she is bound to the world, but inwardly she may be freed of all that is not God. When nothing of self obstructs the sight, she lives by the life of glory, quietly and without intermediary. She is in paradise, though she still moves among the ordinary things of earth.

This may sound like a contradiction, but truth does not bend to appearances. The soul rests in what cannot be explained, only known. And in that knowing, she sits in a gentle freedom, resting in a pure nothingness beyond thought.

> In: *You are my only paradise*

> Out: *Nothing stands between us*
