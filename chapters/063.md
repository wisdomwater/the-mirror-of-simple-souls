## Day 63 — Beyond the Counsel of Reason

> There is a quiet knowing that cannot be reached by reasoning, only by resting in Love.

This path is not easily explained, nor is it meant for those who only wish to understand it from a distance. It is tasted, not argued. Just as a weary body cannot run and a trembling swimmer cannot cross deep waters, so a soul bound tightly to reason alone cannot move freely in this country of Love.

The soul who has entered this peace begins to notice how heavy the teachings of reason once felt. She does not despise them, for they served their time, but she can no longer live there. Reason always asks for proofs, measures, and outcomes. It weighs, compares, and worries. But this soul has fallen into a deeper quiet, a place where God works within her without her striving.

She remembers how she once followed every instruction, fearing she might miss the way. Now she sees that if she returns to that anxious labor, she would only disturb the gentle work already being done in her. What God is doing cannot be improved by her effort. It can only be received.

So she lets the old arguments fall silent. She no longer seeks God through outward striving or careful calculations. Instead, she rests in the fire of love that quietly consumes her, until even her own will becomes soft ash, carried into the great sea of divine charity.

**Breath Prayer**

> In: *Beyond reason, I rest*

> Out: *Love carries me deeper*
