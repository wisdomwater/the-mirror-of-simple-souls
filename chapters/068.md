## Day 68 — The Place Where Only Love Remains

> The soul becomes most herself where she can no longer find herself at all.

There comes a point in the journey where the soul is drawn so deeply into God that she no longer sees either him or herself as separate. She is held in a quiet brightness where the eyes of divine majesty look upon her, and she rests without effort, without striving, without even the need to understand what is happening.

If she were to look back at herself, she would return to her own interests, her own concerns. But here, she is left in God, and God sees his own bounty shining in her. What he gave from the beginning now blooms quietly within her, and in this gift she has been made a lady—free, noble, and unbound.

Nothing remains but him. Nothing is loved but him, because nothing truly is but him. In this simple aloneness, she becomes a solitary soul, yet filled with the fullness of all. This is the most gentle and noble state the soul can know in this life: to be held in the single being of Love.

And from this place, she no longer clings to herself, nor to others, nor even to her own spiritual efforts. She leaves everything in the knowing of divine wisdom, the strength of divine power, and the kindness of divine goodness. Love alone carries her.

In that surrender, she receives a freedom that endures, a gift that does not break or fade, because it is held entirely in God.
