## Day 48 — The Fire Without Smoke

> *There is a love that no longer measures itself.*

Love speaks of souls who live carefully within grace. They avoid harm, keep themselves from excess, and hold their desires in check. They accept loss and gain without rebellion, choosing obedience over indulgence. This life is good. It is enough for salvation. And yet the soul, speaking freely, calls it small—not in judgment, but in proportion. Compared to what lies beyond, it is narrow, enclosed, satisfied too soon.

Reason protests, anxious to protect goodness from being diminished. Love answers gently: the difference cannot be written. It can only be seen by contrast. Between the life of grace and the life of spirit there is already a great widening. Between the life of spirit and the life of glory, the widening becomes immeasurable.

Some souls go further. They do not forget the sufferings of love—the humiliations, the poverty, the weight borne without defense. These remain a living mirror to them, not as obligation, but as remembrance. They are given what they need. They are courteous. Still, even this is not the end.

Truth speaks at last of those who have died the final death. These souls bear the flower of divine love. Nothing stands between them and the Deity—not effort, not feeling, not even holy desire. They cannot endure being thanked by lesser loves. They are held by a single power: love itself.

This love gives stillness and depth, and also flame. It burns without smoke, without fear, without self. Here the Beloved works freely. And the soul, no longer managing her goodness, rests inside the fire that has become her home.
