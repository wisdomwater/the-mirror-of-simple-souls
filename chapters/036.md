## Day 36 — Given All, Receiving All

> *What is emptied into love becomes a dwelling for what cannot be contained.*

Holy Church recognizes what has quietly happened: a soul dead to the world becomes a place where God chooses to live. Not by effort, not by elevation, but by a mutual dying—world to soul, soul to world—until space opens. And where space opens, the Trinity makes a home.

Love names such souls “Holy Church” itself—not as an institution, but as a living body that sustains, teaches, and nourishes. Through them, Love moves; through them, God gives. This does not diminish those who walk by reason. It does not shame the careful or the faithful. It simply names a difference of leading. Reason guides some. Love carries others. Both belong.

Reason asks again for clarity, worried that words might confuse. Love smiles at the worry. What has already been given does not need explaining. The Spirit speaks plainly: nothing is withheld from a soul that has withheld nothing. Whatever Love possesses by nature, the soul receives by love’s justice—not as payment, but as likeness.

The soul gave everything—what she had, and even what she did not have—without bargaining, without a glance toward reward. She would give even God back to God, if she could, simply because love moves that way. And so Love answers in kind. Not with wages, not with honor, but with itself.

Love can only be met by love.
And love, once given wholly, is never returned empty.
