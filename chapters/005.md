## Day 5 — When Virtue Releases Its Hold

> *What once trained the heart eventually steps aside for Love itself.*

The soul speaks now with relief, not rebellion. She remembers how she once gave herself completely to the virtues—obeying them without reserve, enduring their discipline, accepting their demands. They were her teachers and her taskmasters. Under their care she learned vigilance, restraint, and sacrifice. She fought tirelessly against every rising fault, watching her thoughts, words, and actions, often tasting bitterness and fatigue. This was no small labor, and it marked her deeply.

For a long time, the virtues ruled her life. They required fasting, wakefulness, renunciation, and careful obedience. In their service, she suffered many interior struggles, sharp pains of conscience, and long seasons of effort. Yet this labor was not wasted. Like biting through the hard shell of a nut, she endured the roughness in hope of sweetness.

And then the sweetness came.

When the soul finally tastes the love of God—not as an idea, but as living presence—everything shifts. Love begins to work freely within her. The sharp edge of effort softens. Fear, doubt, and bitterness lose their power. What once felt heavy becomes light. What once demanded strain now moves naturally.

The virtues do not disappear. They are gathered inward, no longer imposed from outside. The soul does not reject them; she surpasses their governance. She is no longer driven by command but carried by love. And so she may say she has taken leave of virtue—not abandoning it, but resting beyond its discipline, where Love quietly leads without pain.

> Out: *I release all compulsion*
