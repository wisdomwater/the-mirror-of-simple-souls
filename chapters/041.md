## Day 41 — Clothed in the More

> *Peace arrives where nothing needs to be added.*

This soul is said to have entered the waves of divine love—not by reaching, not by understanding, not by effort refined into holiness. Love itself has drawn her in. She is clothed, not instructed; immersed, not advanced. What surrounds her is not something she possesses, but something she abides within, a peace so complete it holds past, present, and future without asking the soul to account for herself.

Here, likeness replaces striving. As iron loses its own appearance when fire takes hold of it, so the soul is warmed through by a greater life. She does not disappear, yet she no longer stands apart. She lives without her own being, upheld by a gentleness that neither helps nor hinders, neither commands nor rescues. Nothing added improves this place. Nothing removed threatens it.

Even God is no longer approached as resource or remedy. The soul does not ask for power, wisdom, or intervention. She rests in praise alone—simple acknowledgment of what is. This is what gives her peace: not certainty, not effort, but a quiet union where all divisions fall away.

In this dwelling, the soul allows others to move by other paths. She does not interfere. She beholds both the depth of her own nothingness and the vastness of divine fullness at once. Deep answers deep. High meets high. And she remains there, holding both without strain, waiting without thought.
