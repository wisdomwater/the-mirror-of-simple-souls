## Day 38 — Believing the More, Resting in Naught

> *When all knowing dissolves, only wonder remains.*

The soul begins to see that nothing can truly be known. Even if every insight promised to heaven were gathered and weighed, it would still be nothing when set beside the smallest glimmer of God’s bounty. Not power, not wisdom, not goodness can be measured here—only the faintest spark, and even that overwhelms all comparison. What we touch is never God’s fullness, only the edge of what cannot be held.

Stunned by this, the soul asks what such believing now requires. The answer is simple and disarming: nothing. God does the work, quietly and completely, without the soul’s help. By knowing her nothingness, and trusting the More beyond it, the soul is set free from doing. She lacks nothing because she wills nothing. Freedom arrives not as possession, but as release.

Reason hesitates, uneasy with naming anything in God as “nothing.” But the soul sees more clearly now. Even the greatest gifts, even the most luminous will, are nothing when placed beside the immeasurable All. If the least of God is so vast, what must the whole be like? The soul rests there, content not to understand.

From this resting comes peace. Having abandoned every hidden demand, the soul carries peace wherever she goes. She no longer judges, but leans instinctively toward the best. Her knowing has thinned into simplicity. Her willing has softened into trust.

Something widens here, still unfinished, still drawing her onward.
