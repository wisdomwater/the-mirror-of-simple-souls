## Day 27 — Finding God Without Going Anywhere

> *Nothing is sought, because nothing is absent.*

Love speaks of a soul that will not act for high or low, for gain or loss, unless it pleases something deeper than circumstance. Reason understands now: this is not stubbornness, but innocence. Like a child who moves only from its own quiet center, the soul refuses whatever would disturb its inward peace. Not from fear of the world, but from fidelity to a gentler gravity.

Such souls are drawn upward by the work of the Spirit itself. They cannot bear touches that are not love, or at least leading toward love. Their bodies, their choices, their outward movements no longer decide first. They wait. They attend. They follow what God is already doing. Anything else would jar the stillness, and Love teaches them to protect that stillness without effort.

Reason asks whether the soul needs to be summoned to hear of God. Love replies almost playfully: the soul already knows. God is found where God is—and God is everywhere. So every place is suitable. Nothing appears without also revealing God. Why call the soul away from this?

And yet Love speaks one last word, not to inform, but to empty. Everything ever said about God, everything that could still be said, is nothing compared to what God is. Even the vision of the Beloved does not comprehend him. What matters most cannot be spoken, remembered, or learned.

Hearing this, the soul rests more deeply still, believing nothing better could ever be said, and remaining open, without needing more.
