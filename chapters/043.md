## Day 43 — Beyond the Counsel of Virtue

> *What feels highest can still be a place to stop.*

The soul speaks gently but clearly about those who live entirely by desire and devotion. They love the life of virtue, delight in its warmth, and cannot imagine anything finer. Like the crow who believes no bird more beautiful than its own, they are convinced this way is the summit. Their longing keeps them moving, their goodness keeps them busy, and so they remain enclosed within what they feel and choose.

The Virtues themselves object. They insist that no one who follows their counsel with sincerity could be lost. They trust desire, trust effort, trust the feeling of closeness to Christ that arises through faithful work. Love does not argue. She simply says that the mystery does not lie in belief, but in understanding—and understanding is not the office of the Virtues. They were never meant to carry the soul all the way.

The soul does not despise them. She thanks them. Yet she names a quiet truth: one who serves a poor lord receives poor wages. The Virtues can only give what they possess, and they do not possess fine love. They serve well, but they do not know the dwelling place beyond service.

So the soul points elsewhere—not to a love that follows knowing, but to a love that gives birth to knowing. This Love does not strive or instruct. She knows the All, and the More than all. And the free soul, having passed beyond sufficiency, rests there without effort, unable to do otherwise, waiting for nothing but what may arise.

> In: *I release good striving*

> Out: *I rest in greater love*
