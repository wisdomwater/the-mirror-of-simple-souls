## Day 50 — The Secret Court of Love

> *There is a place where nothing is received except what love gives.*

Love says the soul now lives in God, of God, and for God—receiving nothing from any other source. She rests where all flows from the Father, who gives without borrowing, whose being is simply his own. In this divine life, the soul is drawn into the movement of the Trinity itself, so joined to the divine will that she cannot will apart from it. A deep light touches her, pierces her, and quietly feeds her from what is nearest.

From this place, she looks back at the old labors of Reason. They seem heavy, crowded with effort, full of striving for sustenance and security. People work and struggle, believing this toil is all there is. And yet Christ has not abandoned them. He has promised to keep them, to meet them even in their labor, to give them refreshment through the teachings and scriptures they hold dear.

But the free soul refreshes herself elsewhere. Her rest does not come from effort or from what can be earned or studied. She drinks from another well, one that lies beyond speech, beyond comparison, beyond time itself. What she receives cannot be measured by days or duties. It is given only in the quiet moments of union, when love draws her into a stillness that the body cannot long contain.

There, in the secret court of God, courtesy is the law, love the measure, and bounty the food. The sweetness draws her, the beauty satisfies her. Nothing more needs to be asked.
