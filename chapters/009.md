## Day 9 — The Most Perfect Gift

> *When the soul becomes nothing in herself, God quietly becomes everything.*

These souls see themselves as nothing at all—not from self-contempt, but from clarity. Sin is no-thing, and apart from God they claim no substance of their own. In their own sight, they do nothing. What is good is done in them by God alone. Their will has been wholly planted in God, so that nothing rises in them apart from what God wills. Desire no longer initiates movement; Love moves first, and the soul consents without strain.

This does not mean indulgence or carelessness. Love itself extinguishes what would turn toward harm. These souls are so illumined, so inwardly ordered by grace, that coarse desire loses its grip. Temptation is quieted not by resistance, but by a stronger presence. God the Holy Spirit works freely in them, adorning them with a nobility that leaves no room for blemish to remain.

They do not carry anxiety about what they lack. Need is felt only when it is present, and even then without weight. Such lightness belongs only to innocence. Reason stumbles here, unable to follow. Love answers plainly: this cannot be grasped by learning, discipline, or even fervent devotion. It is given—sometimes in a moment—and must be guarded gently once received.

This is the most perfect gift God gives to a creature. Such a soul rests at once in humility, in truth, and in love—seated low, open wide, and utterly at peace.
