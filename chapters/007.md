## Day 7 — When Love Takes the Lead

> *Freedom arrives when Love moves first, and the soul no longer pushes herself forward.*

Love says this soul has passed beyond service. She carries the fullness of virtue within her, yet she no longer strains toward it or watches herself for progress. God has seen her labor long enough. What once ruled her now releases its grip. Reason asks when this soul was a servant, and Love answers gently: when she led herself—when she drove her own obedience, even toward good.

These souls have known that life well. They remember the cost of always taking the lead—how virtues demanded everything from nature, leaving no place to rest. Under that rule, the soul can feel pressed to the edge, clinging to obedience even at the price of inward torment, just to be certain of salvation. Love does not deny the faithfulness of that path. But Love also knows its weight.

Now something has shifted. Love itself has begun to lead. Virtues still act, but without strain or resistance. They no longer command; they respond. The soul does not manage them. They move freely, as servants of Love, not overseers of the heart.

These free souls have no will to secure outcomes. They do not ask for assurance, purification, or reward. They leave all such knowing in God’s keeping. To want certainty would be to step back into control. Instead, they live quietly—by listening, by knowing Love, by a continual inward magnifying that does not examine itself.

They are no longer busy deciding who they are becoming. They are simply being carried.
