## Day 77 — The Questions Love Asks

> *The deepest questions of the soul are born not from her searching, but from love drawing her inward.*

Reason wonders how the soul can speak of questions she does not even know. Love answers gently: it is God himself who forms these questions within her. They rise from the quiet drawing of his love, beyond anything creatures can understand. The soul does not invent them. They are shaped in her without her knowing, like a secret movement beneath the surface of the sea.

She marvels at this. Why should anyone else know these questions, when even she does not know them? Only the One from whom she comes can understand them. He is the secret of the love that lives between them. This love holds her, surrounds her, and remains hidden even from her own awareness.

God continually gives her new love, drawing her toward himself. Yet the work he does within her remains a mystery. She cannot grasp it, and neither can the saints or angels. Only the One who is both One and Three knows the depth of this hidden exchange.

So the soul is invited to remember two simple truths. First, she was made from nothing, and in herself she remains nothing. Second, she has often used her will against the will of God, turning away from the goodness freely given.

In seeing these things, the soul becomes honest and clear, ready to rest again in the mercy that first called her into being.

> Out: *I return to your mercy*
