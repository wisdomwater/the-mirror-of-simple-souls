## Day 6 — Lost in the Right High

> *There is a knowing so full it leaves nothing left to grasp.*

Love says this soul no longer measures life by opposites. Shame and honor, lack and abundance, comfort and pain, even heaven and hell—none of these hold her attention. Reason is startled by this, asking how such words can be spoken. Love answers quietly: this cannot be learned from scripture alone, nor reached by effort or deserving. It is given. The soul is drawn into the Right High and lost there—not by ignorance, but by an overflow of knowing that dissolves the need to understand.

In this fullness, the soul becomes “naught” in her own sight. She knows everything and knows nothing. She wills everything and wills nothing. This does not mean confusion or emptiness, but a yielding so complete that personal will no longer leads. What moves now is the will of God, flowing through her without resistance. Love acts in her without strain, and unrest cannot remain.

Because outward desire has fallen silent, the soul can no longer speak about God as an object. Words belong to wanting, and wanting has died. What remains is simple faithfulness—living by habit, by the customs of goodness, by the life of the Church—not from hunger or longing, but from quiet accord. Desire once gave energy to virtue; now love gives rest.

Reason fears this loss, mistaking stillness for absence. But Love insists this soul is not deprived. She is free. And freedom of this kind is not felt as sweetness, but as peace so deep it no longer needs to be named.
