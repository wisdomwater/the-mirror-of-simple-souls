## Day 18 — Resting Where God Rests

> *There is a place where the soul abides so deeply that passing things no longer disturb her center.*

Love speaks of a soul whose will has been so gathered into God that it no longer moves on its own. She wills only what God wills in her, and this willing feels small—not because it is wrong, but because it is only a beginning compared to what God ultimately desires to give. Her own sufficiency has been emptied, not as a loss, but as a clearing. And in this clearing, she can be said both to will and not to will, to know and not to know.

This soul sets her attention not on what passes, but on what abides. Her thoughts rest in the Trinity, and because of this, she no longer craves spiritual practices as sustenance. These are nourishment for those still moved by hunger, but this soul does not hunger in the same way. Nothing outside her draws her, because what she loves is already her dwelling place.

This does not mean she is indifferent in a cold or careless way. Her peace is not her own invention. It comes from being held where God is at ease. From there, distress cannot take root. Even the weight of sin and suffering does not disturb her center, not because these do not matter, but because their healing does not depend on her agitation.

If she could help another, she would do so freely. Yet her inward life remains anchored beyond what passes. Her thoughts are too spacious to be consumed by what rises and falls. They rest where goodness is larger than comprehension, and from there, they remain open—quietly attentive, without being pulled away.

> Out: *I release all disturbance*
