## Day 69 — The Silence Where Love Lives

> When Love takes you, seeking fades into a quiet, living presence.

There is a difference between seeking Love and being taken by it. When the soul still reaches out with desire, she searches, longs, and strains toward what she hopes to find. This seeking is sincere, but it still belongs to the life of effort, where the spirit feels its own movements and measures its own devotion.

But when Love itself draws near and gently annihilates the soul—making her nothing in herself—everything changes. She no longer seeks God, because Love now lives within her without her effort. God is drawn close, not by searching, but by simple being. She begins to live a divine life, quiet and luminous, carried by Love’s own presence.

This is the life Mary Magdalene found in the desert, when her searching fell silent and Love held her. And this is the life the Virgin Mary knew always: not a life of restless longing, but of steady union. She willed only what God willed, and this single intention became her peace, her love, her praise, and her rest.

The language of this life is not words or thoughts. It is a deep, interior silence, where the soul knows from far off and from long ago that nothing is more divine than to will only the divine will.

In this silence, desire grows still, and Love alone remains.

**Breath Prayer**

> In: *Love draws near within*

> Out: *I rest in silent union*
