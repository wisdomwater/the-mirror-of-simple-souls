## Day 47 — A Gleam Without Measure

> *What is given too quickly to perceive is often given most truly.*

Love speaks of lives that rise beyond comparison, not by climbing, but by being freed. The earlier estates, however good, still carry the weight of service. Even devotion can feel like labor. But there comes a dwelling where charity loosens every bond, and another where glory flashes open for a moment—brief, ungraspable—like a sudden gleam from a farther shore. This is not yet fullness, only a mercy: a hint of what the soul will one day know without end.

In that instant, something stranger still occurs. The soul does not perceive herself receiving anything. How could she? In the moment of the gift, she has become of the same nature as the gift itself. There is no distance left from which to observe. Were the body released, this knowing would not close again—but even so, the Beloved says there is no need to hurry. What is given is already complete.

Then Love names the far night. It is not absence, nor confusion, nor trial. It is the Trinity itself, opening and moving within the soul. What is shown there cannot be reported. The knowing is so bright it removes all knowing. God is known, and therefore unknowable. The soul is seen, and therefore forgotten. Everything is held in divine being, and so disappears from view.

This, Love says, is the most trustworthy knowledge of all. To know that knowing will be taken. To see that seeing must fail. And to rest quietly in that loss, where nothing needs to be secured, and nothing more needs to happen.
