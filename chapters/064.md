## Day 64 — The Gift That Needs No Seeking

> When Love gives itself freely, the soul no longer searches for what is already within.

The soul who has been drawn into the fire of charity finds herself strangely free. She is no longer restless in prosperity, nor shaken in hardship. Something deeper than circumstance holds her steady. And from this quiet center, she discovers she no longer seeks God in the ways she once did.

She does not look for him in penances, or in outward works, or even in the sweetness of consolations. Not because these are wrong, but because she has been carried into a place where seeking has given way to receiving. What she once pursued now lives gently within her.

Reason trembles at this and calls it dangerous. It cannot understand a life that is not measured by effort, progress, or visible devotion. But the soul who has tasted this country knows that what seems strange from afar is simply natural there.

It is like a king who gives a faithful servant a gift so generous that the servant never again needs to labor for his bread. The wise do not question such generosity. They recognize the goodness of the king and rejoice in the freedom of the gift.

So it is with this soul. Her Beloved is rich beyond measure, and from that abundance he fills her quietly. She no longer seeks him in fleeting comforts. He has called her into peace.

Like Mary at the feet of her Lord, she rests in the one thing needed, while many intentions fall away like dust.

**Breath Prayer**

> In: *Your gift is already here*

> Out: *I rest in your peace*
