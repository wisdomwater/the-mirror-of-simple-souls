## Day 76 — The Gift That Gives All

> *When the soul offers her will back to God, she discovers that nothing has ever been withheld.*

The soul reflects on the gift she has received and realizes that God has given her nothing but her free will. At first this seems small, almost like a single coin placed in her hand. But she begins to see more deeply. In giving her this freedom, he has given her everything, for love does not hold itself back.

If her will turns toward him, nothing remains outside her reach, because the Beloved keeps nothing hidden from the one who loves him. Love requires such openness. It would not be love if it withheld itself. And so she becomes certain: nothing has been kept from her.

Yet this fullness is not taken by force. It is received when she freely returns her will to him, just as he first gave it to her. She offers it back without bargaining, without keeping a portion for herself. In that exchange, the gift is completed.

She comes to understand that the small inclinations and weaknesses of the body are not the same as a fall of the heart. The body may lean toward lesser things, but if the will does not consent, the soul remains free. Each moment of resistance becomes a quiet rising.

So even the one who stumbles often may still be called righteous, for the will keeps turning back toward the light. And in that turning, the soul lives in peace—not the peace of her own virtue, but the peace that flows from God himself.
