## Day 21 — Known Only from Within

> *What God finishes in the soul is hidden even from the soul itself.*

Reason asks, gently but insistently, who could ever truly know such a soul. Love answers without hesitation: only God. Not because the soul is distant or obscure, but because it has been brought so fully into God that even self-knowledge loosens its grip. The soul is filled and emptied at once—fulfilled by love, and then forgotten into love—until there is no remaining edge by which it might be grasped.

This is why the virtues no longer stand above the soul as measures or demands. They have become servants rather than masters. They exist for the soul’s sake, not the soul for theirs. The soul’s obedience has narrowed into a single listening: receiving what God gives where desire and will no longer press forward. What remains is spacious enough for singular gifts—gifts that cannot be taken, only received.

Such souls are not recognized from the outside. They cannot be cataloged or confirmed. They are daughters and companions of the King, yet their dignity does not announce itself. To be known in that way would require entry, and nothing enters these souls except the God who made them.

Those who live in this same gift may sense one another—not by titles or signs, but by a shared way of being, a quiet consonance. Still, even then, the soul’s full worth remains undisclosed.

It rests, complete, in the One who alone knows what has been done there.
