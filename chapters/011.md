## Day 11 — Alone in Love

> *There comes a stillness where faith breathes without effort and love stands unaccompanied.*

There is a state of soul so emptied of self that nothing clings for long. Thoughts arise and pass quickly, like birds crossing an open sky, because something deeper has taken residence. Faith lives here—not as effort or proof, but as quiet confidence. It knows the goodness of God without trying to understand it. It does not grasp; it rests. And in this resting, the soul is sustained.

This does not mean that life becomes idle or withdrawn from the world. Rather, the source of movement changes. God works, and the soul consents. What happens outwardly matters less than what is trusted inwardly. The soul no longer leans on its own goodness or measures itself by its deeds. It entrusts everything to the goodness that holds it, and this trust becomes its life.

In this place, love stands alone. The soul no longer looks to created things—neither in heaven nor on earth—for comfort, reassurance, or identity. Its hope gathers into one simple orientation: the goodness of God. It asks nothing else. It waits for nothing else.

Here, even the idea of “doing something for God” loosens its grip. The soul is so turned toward love that self-concern fades. It does not calculate sacrifice or obedience. Nothing within it resists the will that moves through it. There is no inner argument, no bargaining, no holding back—only a quiet alignment that does not need to name itself, and does not hurry to finish.
