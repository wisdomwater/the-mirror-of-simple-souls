## Day 62 — Where the River Loses Its Name

> The soul finds her rest where her own name dissolves into the sea of Love.

There comes a quiet turning in the soul, where she no longer weighs justice against mercy, nor measures what is right or owed. She plants everything into the single will that moves her from within. What once felt like her own choosing softens, and she begins to sense that her will has been gently drawn into another Will—wider, kinder, and more certain than her own.

Love has clothed her in itself so completely that she trusts she can no longer will anything apart from it. She is of Love, in Love, and for Love, carried along without strain. Her thoughts, once restless and dividing, are now like a flood that has overflowed its banks and disappeared into the sea.

She becomes like a river that once had a name, winding through many lands, doing its work. But when it reaches the sea, its name is lost. The river does not struggle or mourn its course. It rests, its labor finished, and becomes the sea itself.

So it is with the soul. Her separate name fades. She is no longer one thing beside another. Love has drawn all her nature into itself, until Love and the soul are not two, but one simple accord.

And yet, just beyond this union, there waits an even deeper nearness—a mysterious nothingness where she lives no longer by grace or spirit alone, but in a quiet, divine freedom.

> Out: *My name rests in you*
