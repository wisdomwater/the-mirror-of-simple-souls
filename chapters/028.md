## Day 28 — Sufficed Only by the Beloved

> *Nothing less than Love itself can quiet the soul that has given everything.*

The soul turns to Love with a wounded honesty. Why was I made, redeemed, drawn so near, only to be given so little? If I had anything of my own, I would give it all—but I have already given everything. Body, heart, soul. And now there is nothing left to offer. Love listens and answers gently: what you gave was never yours to begin with. And this is not loss, but the best that could happen to you.

Still, the soul aches. In the beginning, Love spoke of companionship without hierarchy, of lover and Beloved moving as equals. Now the soul sees the difference clearly: one has all, the other nothing. And if it could be changed, the soul would change it. It would love God with a love as vast as God deserves.

Love quiets the striving without correcting the longing. Your will is enough. Your desire has reached its end. And Love offers a strange comfort: you will love nothing without God, and God will love nothing without you. This union is not possession, but mutual belonging.

Yet even this does not fully satisfy the soul. Not because the gift is small, but because anything that can be received still feels like less than Love itself. The soul cannot stop longing—not even to save the world—because to settle would be to fall back from love’s edge.

What finally suffices is this alone: the Beloved lacks nothing. God is full beyond knowing. And loving one who is complete becomes the soul’s only rest.
