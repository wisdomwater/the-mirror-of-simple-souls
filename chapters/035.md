## Day 35 — Knowing Nothing, Having All

> *There is a fullness that arrives only when nothing is held.*

Seeing herself beneath all things, the soul no longer measures herself by sin or virtue, loss or gain. Evil has been seen clearly enough to lose its power, and goodness is trusted only where it belongs—in God alone. Hope no longer leans on what might yet be done, nor despair on what has already failed. Everything rests in the goodness of the Beloved, hidden and inexhaustible.

That hidden goodness works inwardly, so deeply that the soul is undone by it. Feeling loosens its grip—both the ache of longing and the comfort of consolation. The soul no longer performs works, not for God and not even for her own soul. She cannot search for God, nor locate Him within herself, nor guide her way forward. The familiar faculties have gone quiet. She has lost herself into something larger.

Love says she is no longer with herself. She is excused from all accounting, because the One in whom she rests is now doing the work. Asked where she is, Love answers simply: she is where she loves. Not by knowing. Not by choosing. By being carried.

Here, nothing is willed—not paradise, not escape, not reward. Nothing is resisted either—not even suffering. The soul does not choose because she no longer stands apart to choose. Holy Church listens, startled into reverence, and the Spirit answers with gentleness.

She knows one thing only: that she knows nothing.
She wills one thing only: that she wills nothing.

And in this unknowing, un-willing openness, Love gives everything—quietly, without end.
