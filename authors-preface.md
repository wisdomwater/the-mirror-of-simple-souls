## Author’s Prologue

I am a creature shaped by the One who made me.
From that same Source comes this book—though how or why, I cannot fully say. I do not claim ownership of it, nor do I pretend to understand it by my own skill. It is enough for me to know that through it, I have glimpsed something of divine wisdom.

With hope, I offer this work in peace and love, held within the life of the Holy Trinity. I trust that what is true in it will be confirmed—not by my words—but by the living witness of those who have read it and found their lives quietly transformed.

The first to read it was a Franciscan friar, known for a life of deep devotion. He received it as a gift of love and passed it on in the same spirit, saying that it was written not for argument or display, but for the glory of God, for the freedom of those already drawn into divine life, and for the gentle awakening of those who may yet be.

He spoke plainly and without exaggeration: this book, he said, arises from the movement of the Holy Spirit. And even if all the learned people in the world were to hear it, only those who carry a deep inner awareness—and who are already being shaped by the same work within—would truly understand it. He urged that it be shared with care, and with few, because its meaning cannot be grasped by curiosity alone. He himself admitted that its depth exceeded his own understanding.

After him, a monk of the Cistercian order read it—one well trained in Scripture. He found nothing in it that contradicted the sacred writings, but rather saw them quietly fulfilled.

Later still, a master of theology read it and raised no objection. Yet he offered a wise caution: this book should not be given to many. Not because it is false, but because it speaks of a calling that cannot be chosen or imitated by effort alone. Some, hearing of it, might abandon the work they are truly given, chasing a state that has not been asked of them. In doing so, they could deceive themselves.

For this book speaks from a spirit that is sharp and strong, and such spirits are rare. Still, the soul does not come into full union with divine life without first being shaped by this deeper way. All ordinary practices of devotion remain beneath it—not discarded, but completed. This is not one spiritual habit among many; it is the work of God alone, when and how God chooses.

These words were received and tested for the peace of those who heard them. And for your peace, they are offered now. If this seed finds worthy ground, it will bear holy fruit—not by force, but by love.
