## Day 15 — Beyond Preference

> *When love becomes simple, the soul loosens its grip on every opposite.*

Reason speaks honestly here, naming what feels impossible to reconcile. The soul described in this book appears indifferent to everything that usually governs a spiritual life: shame or honor, poverty or wealth, comfort or suffering, love or hatred, even paradise or hell. She seems to possess everything and nothing at once, to know and not know, to will and not will. To Reason, this sounds dangerous, even irresponsible. Reason can only counsel effort, discipline, fear of loss, and longing for reward. It knows how to strive, how to restrain, how to aim the will toward holiness through desire and renunciation.

Love does not dismiss Reason. It honors it, but places it in its proper realm. What Reason governs well belongs to those still led by desire and fear. But the souls led by Fine Love live from a different center. They are no longer pulled back and forth by preference. They do not choose shame over honor or honor over shame, poverty over riches or riches over poverty. They do not seek suffering, nor do they avoid it. They do not cling to consolation, nor recoil from desolation.

This is not because they are numb or careless. It is because their will no longer fastens itself to outcomes. Their willing has grown quiet, gathered into one consent: whatever God wills in them. In this consent, opposites lose their power to command. Paradise and hell no longer function as rewards or threats, but as names that fall away before love itself. The soul remains free—not by choosing correctly, but by resting where choosing no longer needs to finish.
