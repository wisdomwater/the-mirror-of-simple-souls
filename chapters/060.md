## Day 60 — The Sea That Carries You Home

> The shore you long for appears when your will falls quiet in the waves.

By a soft and secret light, the soul begins to glimpse the edges of the country where she truly belongs. It is not a place she can reach by effort or strength. Between her and that homeland stretches a vast sea, and the crossing cannot be made by the power of her own will. The waves ask for something simpler and deeper: that she release the need to steer, to grasp, to claim her own direction.

So she loosens her hold. She lets the waters carry what she once clutched. The cedar she seeks grows only beyond this surrender, in the land reached by those who consent to the deep.

At first she feels the weight of her debts, the countless moments she turned from Love and tried to live by herself. The debt seems unbearable, more than she could ever repay. But Love does not ask her to settle the account alone. In a single, tender movement, Love absorbs the debt into its own abundance. What she owes and what Love gives become one.

Then a strange neighbor draws near—not a person, but a quiet ravishment that lifts her beyond herself and drops her gently into the middle of divine love. There she finds herself submerged, sustained by the very love that holds her.

And in that drowning, she discovers a spring rising within, a well of knowing and a stream of praise, flowing from the simple, luminous truth that she is nothing—and in that nothing, she has been given everything.

> In: *Into the deep quiet sea*

> Out: *You carry me home*
