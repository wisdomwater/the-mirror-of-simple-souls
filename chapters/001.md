## Day 1 — The Image That Draws the Heart

> *Love awakens first as a distant beauty that wounds the heart and quietly calls it home.*

You hear of a King whose generosity has no limit, whose gentleness travels farther than rumor, and something in you begins to lean toward Him before you understand why. Yet He feels impossibly far away. You remain in a strange land, aware of the love that has touched you but unable to rest within it. Nothing else quite satisfies now, and this ache becomes your companion.

So love does what love always does—it finds a way to stay near. An image is given, not as possession but as remembrance. Not the King Himself, but a likeness shaped gently enough for your longing to bear. You return to it often, not because it completes you, but because it keeps your heart turned in the right direction. In gazing, you are eased. In remembering, you are lifted.

Still, peace has not yet arrived. The image comforts, but freedom feels partial. You sense that others dwell nearer the source, living in a simplicity you do not yet know. And yet, even here, you are not abandoned. Love has already crossed the distance to you. What freedom exists now is not yours by mastery, but given quietly, because Love loves.

This book, like the image, does not bring you home. It only keeps your face turned toward the One who will. And that may be enough, for now.
