## Day 25 — When Fire No Longer Feels Like Fire

> *The soul becomes what once it felt as God.*

Reason wonders whether such a soul feels joy—either inwardly or outwardly. Love answers quietly: no, not as joy is usually known. Not because something is missing, but because nothing remains to react. Will has fallen silent. Desire has loosened its hold. The soul lives in a kind of death that is not emptiness, but perfect consent.

Love offers an image. One who burns does not feel heat. One who drinks is no longer thirsty. So it is here. The soul has been so wholly taken into the fire of love that it has become fire itself. There is no sensation left to register, no edge where feeling could arise. Love burns of itself, from itself, everywhere and always, without borrowing substance from effort or emotion.

Anything that still seeks a feeling—some sweetness, some assurance, some outward confirmation—still carries mixture. It is not yet all fire. That seeking casts a faint glow, a shimmer of goodness, but not the clear blaze. This soul no longer looks for anything to increase love. And so it sees clearly. Nothing inside it clouds its sight. It appraises all things as they are, without distortion, because it has been emptied into meekness and opened into charity.

Now the soul loves nothing for its own sake—not even holy things—but only because God loves them. God is loved in all things, and all things in God. And in this union, something stranger still occurs: the soul no longer sees itself in God, nor God in itself.

There is only love, without reflection, continuing.
