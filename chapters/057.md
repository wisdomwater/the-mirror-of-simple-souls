## Day 57 — The Freedom That Was Near

> Sometimes the heaviest burdens come from the gentle invitations we once refused.

Love speaks with a quiet sorrow to those who feel weighed down by themselves. She says that she had sent many messages—soft movements, inward lights, warm touches of grace—each one an invitation into freedom. But these were often refused, not with open rebellion, but with hesitation, fear, or delay.

No one else saw these moments. Only Love knew how often she had called, and how gently she had tried to draw the soul out of her own heaviness. The freedom offered was not distant or costly. It asked only a small yielding, a simple trust, a turning of the heart in the direction Love was already pointing.

But when these messages are refused again and again, the soul remains burdened by herself. She carries both the weakness of the body and the unease of the spirit. A quiet heaviness settles in, not because Love has withdrawn, but because the invitations were set aside.

Love does not speak this to condemn, but to awaken. The freedom she offers is still simple. It is still near. It asks for less than the soul fears, and gives more than the soul imagines.

For even now, Love waits, ready to turn the smallest surrender into a wide and open peace.

> Out: *I yield into Your freedom*
