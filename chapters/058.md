## Day 58 — The Sun Within

> When the sun of love rises in the soul, fear and weakness begin to loosen their hold.

Love says that when the true light fills the soul, something changes quietly but deeply. As sunlight reveals the smallest dust in its beam, so the brightness of divine love reveals what once lay hidden. But this light does not come to shame or frighten the soul. It comes to heal.

The One who walked the earth never healed the soul alone or the body alone. He healed both together. And he does the same still, wherever faith and love are welcomed. Where that light is received, the old fears begin to fade, and the heaviness of the body and spirit grows lighter.

Those who are guided by faith and love become free, not by their own efforts, but by what has entered them. Yet this freedom cannot be seized through study, argument, or restless striving. When the soul tries to perfect herself by her own reasoning, she remains tangled in her own thoughts, circling endlessly within herself.

But when the deeper stirrings of the spirit arise—those quiet, burning desires that move the soul toward goodness—these are not to be pushed aside. They are gentle preparations, like humble servants making ready a house for the arrival of a great guest.

For the life beyond effort cannot be forced. It comes to those who have given themselves wholly, and in giving all, they discover that nothing has been lost.
