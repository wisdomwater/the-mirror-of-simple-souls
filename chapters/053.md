## Day 53 — Drawn Beyond the Self

> Love draws the soul so far into God that she forgets herself and awakens in a deeper being.

When the soul is carried by Love into this quiet union, she feels herself drawn out of her small, separate life. It is as though she has been gently taken from herself and placed in a vast, divine garden. There, peace is not something she achieves—it surrounds her, joins her, and holds her in a union she could never create on her own.

God is divine, and in this union the soul discovers a being that is no longer confined to her own narrow measure. She does not become God, yet she lives from a life that flows from God. What is divine touches her so deeply that she begins to taste a freedom that feels beyond anything she once called herself.

In this state, it is not her own effort that acts. God’s work in her is unlike any work she could do by her own strength. The actions of the creature cannot be compared to the quiet, hidden work of God within the creature. One is striving; the other is a gift.

The troubles of the fallen come from clinging to their own will, trying to grasp what can only be received as grace. But the soul who loosens her grip finds herself carried into a settled country, where peace is not fragile or earned, but fulfilled.

There, even the will grows quiet, and something deeper begins to live.
