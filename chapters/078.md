## Day 78 — When Nothing Remains

> *When the soul sees that she has nothing to offer, she falls quietly into the mercy that has always held her.*

The soul considers the weight of even a single fault and begins to see its depth. If justice alone were to settle the debt, she would be stripped of everything, reduced to nothing before it was paid. For all she has ever had was given by God, and even her will was a gift meant to return her to him. Yet she used that will for herself, turning away from the goodness that first called her into being.

She looks at her life and sees not only her poverty, but the hidden faults known only to Truth. Once she was nothing, before she owed anything at all. Now, she feels herself worse than nothing, for she has chosen her own will over the will of God. And with this realization, she no longer pretends to have anything with which to pay her debts.

So she turns to the Beloved without bargaining. She calls upon Justice, Truth, Mercy, and Pity, all dwelling together in him. And then a strange peace comes. She no longer cares which of these meets her. Whether it is justice or mercy, she leaves it entirely in his hands.

Her joy or sorrow no longer depends on what happens to her, but only on him. If he neither gains nor loses, she is content. In this surrender, she becomes one, no longer divided within herself.

> Out: *I rest in your mercy*
