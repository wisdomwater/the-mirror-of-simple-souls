## Day 59 — Melted in the One

> In certain quiet moments, the soul forgets herself because she is resting inside the love that holds all things.

There are times when the soul is so gently drawn into God that her inward movements grow still. It is not that love or kindness leave her, for these remain quietly within, ready whenever there is need. But in those deeper moments, her attention is no longer scattered among outward or bodily concerns. She rests in something more interior, more simple, more whole.

In this union, the soul does not feel herself as separate. She does not stir her own thoughts or push her own desires. Love has drawn her so close that, for a little while, she is like wax softened by warmth—no longer rigid or self-shaped, but quietly held in another form.

The old teachers say that in such moments, God and the soul are not two spirits standing side by side. They are one spirit in that union. Not that the soul becomes God, but that she is gathered so deeply into him that the sense of separation fades.

These moments do not last forever in this life. The soul returns again to her ordinary ways, to her body, to her thoughts, to her tasks. Yet the memory of that oneness lingers like a gentle warmth, and sometimes, by grace, it comes again.

And so the soul learns, little by little, what it means to live from a love that is deeper than herself.
