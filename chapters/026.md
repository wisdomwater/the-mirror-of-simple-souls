## Day 26 — One Will, One Love

> *Pure love asks nothing back, because it no longer stands apart from Love itself.*

Meditation of pure love has only one quiet purpose: to love truly, without reaching for reward. This kind of love cannot arise while the soul is still circling itself, measuring what it receives. It happens only when the soul slips outside self-interest and lets Love take the lead. Here, the soul no longer occupies itself with seeking sweetness or comfort. Its attention rests instead on what God is already doing. God works. The soul yields. Nothing else is required.

To love well, the soul learns not to ask and not to take, but to give without withholding. When love holds more than one aim—loving God and gaining something in return—love thins. So it releases every second intention and becomes single. It trusts that the Beloved knows what is best, and that this knowing is enough. The soul’s willing narrows into one consent: that the will of God be done within it.

In this consent, something dissolves. The soul can no longer will by itself, because its will no longer belongs to it. It has quietly passed into the One it loves. What unfolds here is not the soul’s achievement, but the work of Love itself, moving through the life of the Trinity.

And from this union arises joy—strangely unfelt. The soul swims in delight without noticing delight, because it has become what it once experienced. Drawn into Love, it loses even the name of lover, and rests instead as love alone, loving Love.

> Out: *I rest in Love’s work*
