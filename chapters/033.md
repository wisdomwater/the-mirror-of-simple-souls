## Day 33 — Peace Without Grudging

> *When the will rests inside Love, even memory loosens its hold.*

The soul speaks from a place where willing has become simple. Nothing is chosen apart from God, and nothing God wills is resisted. In this mutual indwelling, peace arises—not because the past has been repaired, but because it no longer argues. Time lost is no longer a weight to carry. Courtesy has already answered it. Wherever the soul turns, peace is there, even in the knowledge of sin, even in the places that once felt most exposed.

The soul dares to see its faults clearly, without hiding and without despair. God alone knows them as they truly are, and heaven will know them too—not as accusation, but as testimony. Mercy will be visible where failure once stood. What seemed only shame becomes a field where generosity is finally seen for what it is.

Perfect charity, Love says, is nothing more than willing God’s will without reserve. Where that willing is whole, conscience no longer clenches. There is no inner bargaining left, no quiet resentment toward oneself or God. The soul was made for this—nothing else but to bear charity without end.

Then the soul falters, startled by its own words. What has been spoken feels smaller than nothing beside what Love is actually doing. Even repentance feels inadequate. Time cannot be recovered. Darkness remains. And yet Love does not withdraw. What the soul names as loss becomes the place Love keeps justice—by holding it gently, without correction.

Something continues, unsummarized, still breathing.
