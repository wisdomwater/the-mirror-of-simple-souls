## Day 51 — The Prayer That Is Not Spoken

> There comes a quiet hour when love rests so fully in God that it no longer knows how to ask for anything.

Some souls try to grasp divine things with clever thoughts and restless efforts, but the deeper knowing does not open to the busy or the proud. These words are not meant to be solved by argument or sharpened understanding. They are written like veils, so that the heart may turn inward and wander gently through them, until it begins to feel what cannot be explained.

For there are souls who have labored long in outward works—prayers, duties, devotions—and yet have not tasted the stillness at the center. Love calls them, sometimes, to lay down their tools and simply behold. “Be still and know,” says the ancient voice. Rest for a time from doing, and let God work quietly within.

When the soul is drawn into this high peace, prayer changes its shape. It is not that prayer disappears, but that the soul’s will has become so gently pressed into God’s will that it no longer knows how to ask for this or that. It desires only what God desires. Even if it could change things by its prayer, it would not. Love is content to let all be as God ordains.

In such moments, the soul does not pray with words. Its very being has become prayer before God.

> Out: *Your will is enough*
