## Day 23 — Leaning into Freedom

> *Love lifts the soul beyond fear, into a steadiness that does not need to brace itself.*

The soul rises like a bird carried higher than effort could ever take it, feathered not with strength but with fine love. It looks toward the sun without flinching and is nourished by what cannot be possessed—the warmth, the radiance, the nearness. In that light, the soul quietly releases its long servitude to necessity and strain. Nature is thanked and gently dismissed. Love has come close enough now to hold the soul free, without defense.

From this freedom, nothing startles the soul out of itself. Loss does not diminish it. Consolation does not inflate it. It remains open-handed, common to all, generous without calculation, asking nothing in return. What fills it comes directly from God, and so it rests with a gladness that does not dissolve into excess, and a seriousness without weight. God’s name has found a home here.

Love says this soul leans on two staffs, and they keep her steady. One is the clear knowledge of her own poverty—a humility that grounds her without shame. The other is an upraised knowing of God—a certainty received, not grasped. Between these two, the soul stands at peace.

And yet Love speaks of a strange intoxication: a drunkenness not from what has been tasted, but from what remains infinitely untasted. The soul is carried by the nearness of a fullness that can never be exhausted, and so it sways gently in awe, supported by what it cannot drink.
