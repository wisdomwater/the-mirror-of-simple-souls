## Day 22 — Beyond the Practice of Virtue

> *What once trained the soul now serves it quietly, having completed its work.*

Reason hesitates, sensing a contradiction: how can the soul have taken leave of the virtues, and yet still be accompanied by them? Love answers with patience. The leaving is not abandonment, but fulfillment. The soul no longer practices virtue as effort or exercise, no longer reaches toward what virtue asks. Yet virtue itself has not departed. It remains, present and obedient, having finished its teaching.

In the beginning, the soul needed guidance. Reason and the virtues stood as teachers, asking for discipline, endurance, and consent even unto death. The soul learned by obeying, shaping itself through attention and practice. This was necessary. It was the way in.

But over time, something deeper was learned—not as instruction, but as being. The soul absorbed all the virtues could offer, and more than they could ever contain. What once ruled now yields, not in defeat, but in recognition. The servant has become richer than the master, not by striving, but by learning love’s language fluently enough to forget the rules.

Now the soul is no longer with itself, nor with virtue as a task. It is turned entirely toward Love. And Love speaks plainly: Love is God. God is Love. The soul, drawn into this intimacy, lives from love’s condition rather than its commands. It is taught without effort, moved without will, upheld without strain.

This is the end of training—not collapse, but flight—where the soul rises, not to escape the world, but to rest in the One who has always been carrying it.
