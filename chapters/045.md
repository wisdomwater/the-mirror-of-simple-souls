## Day 45 — The Far Night’s Gift

> *What opens and closes leaves the soul freer than before.*

Nothing is lacking in her now. At times she is suddenly taken—drawn into a brightness that opens and closes too quickly to be held. This movement belongs entirely to the Beloved. It cannot be summoned, prolonged, or described by anyone who has not been carried by it. It comes as a swift opening and a hasty shutting, and no soul may remain there long.

When the opening closes, the soul does not fall back into striving. She returns to her quiet dwelling where will is absent, and peace remains. The brief ravishment releases her from every weight, discharging her of all encumbrance. As long as this peace endures, she abides freely and nobly, unchanged by effort, untroubled by loss.

Love calls this the work of the far night—like a flash of heavenly lightning that lifts the soul into light and sets her back down again. It does not linger. It passes through in the space of its own movement. Because it cannot be possessed, it remains pure gift. Its sweetness is such that truth itself names it nourishment, yet none may be fed by it who still dwell in desire.

Beyond this, the soul lives a different life altogether. She has passed through the deaths of sin and nature and now lives from a deeper dying still. In this life of glory, she is often without herself—neither in God as an object, nor in herself as a subject, but resting in a holy nothingness where all knowing falls silent, open to whatever may be given next.
