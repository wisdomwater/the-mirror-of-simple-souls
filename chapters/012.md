## Day 12 — Beyond What Can Be Taught

> *There is a knowing that arrives where teaching can no longer follow.*

There comes a point where the soul cannot be instructed by anyone—not because it has mastered all things, but because everything that can be known feels small beside what it loves. Even if it gathered all wisdom past and future into itself, it would seem like nothing when held up against what draws it. What it loves has never been known and never will be known. And strangely, this is not a lack, but a fullness.

The soul finds itself loving what cannot be spoken, what cannot be grasped or stored away. It values what is not possessed more than anything it has received or ever might receive. Compared to this quiet “more,” every gift, every insight, every understanding fades into the background, not rejected, but gently eclipsed.

From here, the soul cannot be robbed. Loss no longer reaches the center. Honor or dishonor, companionship or solitude, even the body and its life—none of these can take away what abides when God abides. What could be stolen when the dwelling place is fullness itself?

Nor can anything be added. Even the greatest gifts fall short of what is already loved. This love is not reached by effort or expanded by accumulation. It remains beyond the farthest edge of knowing, untouched even by the highest vision.

The soul senses this and falls quiet. Words thin out. Love remains, whole and inexhaustible, opening into a depth that does not ask to be completed.
