## Day 31 — Knowing Nothing, Doing Nothing

> *There is a vision the body cannot hold, and a truth the soul learns only by being emptied.*

The soul speaks from astonishment, not from pride. What it has seen—of God, of angels, of souls—feels impossibly large for a human frame. Flesh cannot carry such sight. And so the knowing is given to the spirit alone, held where weight and language fall away. This gift does not inflate the soul; it humbles it into silence. To see so much is to feel unfit to see anything at all.

Love answers gently, without elaboration. When nothingness is truly known, nothing needs to be done. That emptiness itself becomes a kind of knowing, saying everything without words. But when this knowing is partial—when the soul still stumbles between fullness and lack—then some small, honest movement remains, not to earn what has been given, but to avoid turning away from it. Forgetting what one has been, or what one is apart from God, breaks the delicate truth that has begun to form.

The soul does not defend itself. It offers only its faults, naming them as the place where mercy entered. It dares to believe that love would have come even for one alone, that the cross would still have been taken up for this single, fragile life. In that daring, debt becomes confession, and confession becomes trust.

Nothing is claimed. Everything is yielded. What remains waits, unguarded.

> Out: *Your love is enough*
