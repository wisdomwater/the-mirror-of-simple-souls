## Day 3 — Charity Without Measure

> *Love asks for everything, not to take, but to give you back to yourself.*

This book is offered to those who already belong—to those held within the life of the Church, yet still aching for peace. It is not written to teach you how to strive, but to let Love speak where effort grows tired. What is being offered here is not achievement, but a widening of the heart until it rests in charity.

Love reminds you of the ancient call: to love God wholly, and others as yourself. Yet this loving is not a tightening of resolve. It is a loosening. Thoughts settle naturally toward God. Truth becomes simple. Actions grow clean, not because they are perfect, but because they are no longer calculated for gain. Even care for yourself softens, turning away from self-protection and toward trust.

Then Love tells a story you already know—a young man invited to let go of everything and follow. This is not a demand placed upon you, but a glimpse of what happens when charity ripens. Charity no longer bargains. She does not cling, defend, or measure herself. She moves freely, without fear of loss or concern for reputation. She gives before asking, risks before securing, and rests in a generosity that seems foolish to the careful mind.

Charity is not anxious about the world. She is at home in it. And when she gives more than she has, it is because she trusts the abundance of Love itself.

Something in you may already recognize this way.
