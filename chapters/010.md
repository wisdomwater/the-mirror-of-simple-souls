## Day 10 — To Comprehend and Forget

> *Love shows much, then gently takes even that away.*

When this soul beholds God, she sees glory everywhere—power moving through all things, mercy breathing in every act. She recognizes that God is not distant, but wholly present, alive in all that is. And as she looks, Love comes suddenly, wounding her with sweetness. The knowing is so full that it cannot remain. What she just understood slips away, not from loss, but from excess.

In union, she comprehends much. Then, almost at once, she forgets herself and everything she had known before. This forgetting is not carelessness. It is the way Love protects her from clinging. She is given insight only long enough to be drawn beyond it. And so she is called “Forgettelle”—one who understands deeply, and releases quickly.

Reason asks for more names, more clarity, especially for those who long to grow in understanding. Love answers with restraint. True contemplation is not an increase of desire, but its quieting. The contemplative does not accumulate insight. She plants her will wholly in God’s will, letting even holy wanting fall away.

Then Love begins again, speaking of the soul who lives naughted. The first mark of such a soul is that she cannot be found. In her own sight, she is nothing at all—aware only of her frailty apart from God. This is not despair, but meekness so deep it erases self-importance. She does not compare herself upward or downward. She simply disappears into truth.

And in that disappearing, Love remains.
