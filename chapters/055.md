## Day 55 — The Quiet Mountain

> Some lights are shown only to the heart that has climbed beyond its usual concerns.

Love speaks of two sisters: one restless with many tasks, the other resting in quiet presence. The one who is burdened with many cares cannot taste the life of peace, for her hands are always full and her heart is drawn outward. But the one who sits in stillness, like Mary, finds a peace that does not come from her own effort. Her Beloved is the one who quiets her, and so her peace remains.

The soul remembers how the Lord was transfigured on the mountain before only three of his companions. Few are brought to see such brightness, for the vision is not given to the crowded or distracted heart. It is shown to those who have become lovers, whose charity burns quietly and draws them upward.

The mountain is not a place of earth, but a turning away from what is lesser. As long as the soul is occupied with passing things, the deeper secrets remain hidden. But when she rises, even a little, into the heights of love, the light begins to show itself.

And yet, the vision is kept in silence. It is not something to display or boast about. Some lights are meant to be carried quietly within, until the soul has passed through death into a deeper life.

**Breath Prayer**

> In: *Lift my heart to You*

> Out: *Into Your quiet light*
