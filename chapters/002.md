## Day 2 — Freedom That Comes and Goes

> *There is a freedom that visits like light, and leaves without accusation.*

At times you are gathered inward, drawn away from outward noise, and for a brief moment you are simply one with God. In that union, you are free. Not free because you have mastered yourself, but because Love is doing what Love does—holding you without resistance. The time is small, almost unnoticeable as it passes, yet while it lasts, nothing binds you.

Then you return. Sensation stirs again. The old movements resume—the slipping, the fading, the unevenness of being human. This does not undo what happened. The falling belongs to the surface, not to the center. Your will, once turned toward God, remains inclined even when your steps wander. Love does not withdraw its regard.

Grace may live in a soul without end, but the soul cannot remain always in the same stillness. There is a tenderness here, not a failure. What falters is not the deepest desire, but the restless edges of the self. And so Love does not accuse. Love knows the difference.

You are not free because you stand without blemish. You are free because Love keeps choosing you, again and again, even as you move between union and return. This freedom is not possession but gift—arriving, departing, and quietly shaping you in its passing.

And Love, still at work, has more ways to draw you than you yet know.
