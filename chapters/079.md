## Day 79 — The Peace of No Will

> *When love draws the soul beyond herself, she rests where no private will remains.*

The soul looks to the life of the Beloved and sees a simple pattern: the Son desired only the will of the Father. There was no separate claim, no private possession. His whole life was a quiet “yes.” In this, he becomes a mirror. The soul sees that she too is invited into this same single will.

When her will no longer resists, she discovers something surprising: God is already with her. There is no need to search. To seek what is already present is only a sign that she has not yet learned the quiet art of knowing. For true knowing does not come through restless effort. It is given in stillness.

There is a knowledge that grows through thinking and speaking, but this is not the deepest knowing. The deeper knowledge comes from love itself. It is the quiet work of God within the soul, lifting her into a place of gentle rest.

In this place, love leads and the soul follows without strain. She no longer tries to lead love by her own effort, for that would only stir pride and self-concern. Instead, she is carried. Love draws her away from the busy stirrings of her thoughts and senses. She does not lose them, but she no longer lives by them.

Her journey finds its fulfillment here. Her will is gathered up and placed into the One she loves, like a small stream flowing into the wide and quiet sea.
