## Day 14 — The Will That Is Not Willed

> *There is a freedom that appears only when the soul no longer tries to possess itself.*

Here we speak again of the soul made nothing, a soul that has no will of its own and cannot claim one. This sounds like loss to the listening mind, as though something essential were being taken away. Reason strains to reconcile it: how can the soul have full sufficiency if it is denied what it longs to will? How can there be fullness where there is no satisfaction?

Love answers without softening the paradox. Reason, it says, is grasping at husks and missing the grain. The soul that has been freed is no longer measured by what she has or lacks. Her sufficiency is not something given to her as a possession. It is something she enters by dwelling in God, and by God dwelling in her. Here, sufficiency is not owned—it is shared being.

The soul does indeed will the will of God. And the more she wills it, the more she desires to will it still. Yet she cannot complete this desire by herself. Not because she has failed, but because the fullness belongs to God alone. This withholding is not cruelty; it is mercy. It keeps the soul from mistaking a partial union for the whole.

So the soul consents again and again, knowing she cannot finish the movement she has begun. This consent draws her deeper—not into satisfaction, but into glory. What she cannot will for herself is willed in her. And in this not-willing, she is given a life that does not end in possession, but opens endlessly into Being.
