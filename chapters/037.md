## Day 37 — Dead in Love, Alive in Peace

> *There is a knowing that fades into rest when love has finished its long work.*

Love speaks of a soul that once lived by effort—training the will, resisting vice, striving for virtue. This was a true labor, even a holy one, but it was a life of war. To languish for love is to feel that constant ache: wanting God, reaching for God, exhausting oneself in the search. The soul knows this terrain well.

But longing has done its work. What once strained toward love has been overtaken by it. The soul has come to an ending with the world, and the world with her. Not in withdrawal, but in disappearance. She lives now in God so fully that nothing can find her—not fear, not temptation, not accusation. These things search for her in her actions, but she is no longer there.

Here, peace settles without effort. Created things lose their power to disturb because they no longer claim the will. The soul has given that away. Nothing remains to want, because wanting itself has been released. God’s willing has quietly become her only motion.

This is the strange freedom Love names: to will nothing, and therefore to lack nothing. Such a soul would answer any question of desire with a gentle simplicity—nothing. Not because she is empty, but because she is filled elsewhere.

This knowing does not arise from insight or strength. It comes from discovering one’s own nothingness, and trusting the More that holds it. Something rests here now, unguarded, unafraid.

> Out: *I rest in Yours*
