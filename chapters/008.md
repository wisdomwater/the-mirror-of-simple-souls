## Day 8 — When Love Does the Work

> *What once required effort now happens by being held.*

Love speaks of one soul to show the way for many. This soul does not seek hardship or comfort, devotion or neglect. She does not hunger for practices, nor does she resist the needs of her own nature. While she abides in union, will falls silent. Thought does not wander downward. Nothing beneath that union asks for her attention.

There was a time when she labored intensely. Desire pressed her toward sacrifice and discipline. She chose poverty of spirit, endured discomfort, clung to prayer and devotion, and resisted what pleased the flesh. This was not wrong. It was the necessary road—the hard soil through which the roots first grew. Before sweetness can be trusted, it must be tasted honestly.

Then Love arrived with courtesy. Not to cancel the work, but to change how it happens. As divine sweetness fills the soul, she recognizes something quietly: Love’s work draws her more deeply into God than her own striving ever could. Attention shifts. What once consumed her energy now happens simply, by habit and faithfulness, without desire or inner pressure.

She still acts. She still prays. She still lives the rhythms of goodness. But the center has moved. Love now works through her, not alongside her. What she does is no longer hers alone. It is joined to Love, carried upward by it.

And so she allows Love to act freely—trusting that the greatest gift God gives is not effort perfected, but surrender received.

> Out: *I yield the doing*
