## Day 29 — Content with What Cannot Be Known

> *The soul rests because the Beloved lacks nothing.*

The soul speaks with a calm that has passed through longing and arrived somewhere quieter. If I feel the ache of what I do not have, I am healed again by this: the Beloved is lacking nothing. Within God lives the fullness of every good, without limit or diminishment. This becomes the soul’s peace—not what it holds, but what God holds. Loving no longer circles back toward the self. And because the soul loves only for God’s sake, nothing is missing.

Once, the soul delighted in hearing others speak of God, receiving every word with eagerness. Now Love has told the truth and asked the soul to be still. What can be said is nothing compared to what God is. Even love’s own consolations fall short. And this does not trouble the soul. It frees it. The soul discovers a strange satisfaction in this silence: no answer given is better than the mystery that remains.

The soul realizes it loves more deeply what it will never know than what it has already received. The hidden abundance within God feels more its own than any gift brought within reach. Where love leans most fully, there the treasure rests. And love leans toward the unknown “more,” toward the vastness that cannot be grasped or named.

So the soul endures—held by Love itself—content not with possession, but with a Beloved who exceeds every telling, and continues to draw the heart beyond its knowing.
