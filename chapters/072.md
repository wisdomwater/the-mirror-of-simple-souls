## Day 72 — Resting Beyond Thought

> *The deepest freedom comes when the soul falls silent and lets love speak what cannot be said.*

The soul who writes of these things confesses her own foolishness. To put such a mystery into words feels like trying to hold the sea in one’s eye, or to carry the world on the tip of a reed. What she speaks of cannot truly be written. It is too precious, too vast, too alive. And yet she writes, not from her own strength, but because love moves her to speak.

Her words are a kind of burden, and also a refuge. Through them she hopes to reach the place of her final crown—the state where the soul sits in perfect freedom. This freedom is not gained by effort or thought. It comes when the soul rests in a pure nothingness, beyond every image and idea. Until she comes to this rest, she is not yet free.

Reason asks what such souls do, those who live beyond their thoughts. Love answers that they marvel. They stand in wonder before the One who dwells in the heights of their being. At the same time, they are humbled by the depth of their own nothingness. In this silent wonder, something within them is gently sealed and opened, as if in a secret chamber.

Only the gentle dark—the far and near night—holds the key to this mystery. And in that quiet darkness, the soul is led into what she cannot think, only receive.

> Out: *Beyond every thought of mine*
