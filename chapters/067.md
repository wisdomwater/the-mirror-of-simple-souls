## Day 67 — The Peace Beyond Contradiction

> What once required effort becomes natural when the will has quietly merged with Love.

In the earlier stages of the spirit’s journey, the soul often finds peace by going against her own impulses. She learns to refuse what pleases her, to soften the habits of the body and the restless cravings of the heart. In this discipline, something within her begins to loosen. The old sickness of self-will is slowly healed, not by force alone, but by a deeper fire of longing for what is true.

This is the work of the life of spirit—a path where the soul still feels the tension between what she desires and what draws her toward God. In that place, she finds peace by gently choosing what leads her beyond herself, even when it feels unfamiliar or difficult.

But there comes a further crossing.

When the soul has passed through the Red Sea of her old desires, when she has moved beyond virtue into Love, and from Love into the quiet nothingness where she belongs, her will is no longer divided. What pleases her is no longer separate from what pleases God. Her desire has been quietly transformed.

So now, if she were to act against her deepest pleasure, she would lose her peace. Not because she is self-indulgent, but because her pleasure and the divine will have become one simple movement. She does what pleases her, and in that doing, Love itself is pleased.

The struggle has softened into harmony, and the soul rests in a freedom where nothing stands opposed.
