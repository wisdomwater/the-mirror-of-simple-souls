## Day 4 — The Life That Wants Nothing

> *There is a peace so complete it no longer reaches for God, because it rests within Love itself.*

There is a life Love calls “naughted”—not empty, but unburdened. In this life, the soul is saved not by effort, nor by accumulation, but by a faith so simple it no longer knows how to work. Love has become her only movement. She does nothing for God, not because she withholds, but because there is nothing left to offer that is not already God’s. No one can teach her, add to her, or take from her. Her will has fallen quiet.

This soul desires nothing that comes by means. She does not search through intermediaries or borrowed wisdom. She no longer seeks God through ideas, comparisons, or achievements. What is given to her comes directly—from the Beloved to the lover—without distance, without delay.

Love says she has six wings. Two shelter mystery: the more she knows of divine generosity, the more she realizes she does not know. Two cover suffering: the more she beholds the love revealed in Christ, the more she knows it cannot be grasped. And with two she flies—not away from the world, but within it—dwelling steadily in God’s will.

Standing, she is aware of God. Sitting, she is at rest in God. What could threaten her now? Even if everything pressed against her, nothing essential could be lost.

And so Love whispers that such a soul may quietly take leave of the virtues she once served—not in contempt, but in freedom—moving onward without explanation.
