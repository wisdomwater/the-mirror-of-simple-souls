## Day 75 — The Freedom of the Will

> *Even in frailty, the soul carries a freedom that no darkness can steal.*

Body and spirit are joined together in this life, and both are formed by God’s hand. The spirit comes from him, and the body also is shaped by his goodness. These two are bound together in the conditions of this world, where weakness and corruption still linger. Yet in the waters of new birth, they are held within a divine promise, touched by a justice that restores what was wounded.

When a fault appears, even a small one, it troubles the heart. Something in us feels the bitterness of what is not aligned with love. The soul senses that such things are not nothing, because they do not please the Beloved. And yet this sorrow is not meant to become a harsh spirit turned against oneself. It is only a quiet awareness that calls the soul back toward the light.

The soul remembers the saying that the righteous fall many times each day. But not every fall is a turning of the will. Much of what appears as failure comes from the weakness of the body, not the consent of the heart. Where the will does not agree with the fault, the soul remains free.

God’s goodness has given the soul a great gift: a will that cannot be taken away without her consent. Nothing—not even darkness—can steal that freedom. It was given in love, and it remains held in love.
