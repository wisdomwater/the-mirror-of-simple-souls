## Day 13 — When Words Fall Away

> *Even the truest speech grows quiet before a goodness that cannot be spoken.*

The soul begins to notice that all talk about God—even loving talk—falls short. Words circle the mystery but never arrive. The more she hears spoken of divine goodness, the more she feels a gentle embarrassment, not because the words are false, but because they are too small. Praise becomes a kind of holy babbling: forgiven, perhaps even tender, yet unable to touch what it names.

This does not make the soul disdainful of speech; it simply loosens her reliance on it. She learns that nothing said by others, and nothing she herself can say, reaches the heart of what she loves. And so she stops collecting descriptions. She releases the comfort of explanations. She lets even spiritual language fade, trusting that God knows God more truly than any devotion can declare.

In this quieting, something unexpected opens. What cannot be given by anyone is already present. What cannot be added is not lacking. The soul realizes that the greatest gift is not information, nor experience, nor even understanding—but the consent to remain with what surpasses all of these.

Here, will itself softens. The soul no longer strains to choose rightly. What she wills is what God wills in her. Not by effort, not by strength, but by a shared movement that feels less like deciding and more like yielding. She does not lose herself; she is relieved of herself. And in this release, something unsayable continues to unfold.

> Out: *I yield to your will*
