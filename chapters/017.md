## Day 17 — Seeing Without Seeing

> *Faith learns to recognize presence where the senses find nothing to hold.*

Faith offers an image, not to explain the mystery, but to loosen the grip of ordinary seeing. What is given does not disappear when it can no longer be detected. The presence does not arrive by movement, nor depart by absence. What changes is not where Christ is, but how we are able to receive. The form before the eyes remains simple and unassuming, yet faith knows it as fullness. What the senses deny, faith quietly affirms.

This knowing does not compete with reason; it passes beyond it. Faith stands steady where sight falters and touch finds only ordinary substance. It trusts a presence that refuses to announce itself with weight or flavor or proof. And in this trust, something deeper is nourished—not the intellect’s hunger for certainty, but the soul’s capacity to remain with what it cannot manage.

Those who see by glory do not see as we do. They no longer rely on faith, because they dwell in what faith gestures toward. But here, now, faith is the way of seeing. It contradicts the surface of things without anxiety. It rests in what cannot be confirmed by the senses and does not try to force understanding to finish its work.

The soul learns restraint here—not pressing questions too far, not prying open what must be received gently. Light comes as it is given. Understanding ripens as love draws near. And as the soul listens to this quiet knowing, desire simplifies. Will gathers into one motion. Love begins to want only what Love itself desires, and the soul finds herself leaning toward a dwelling she has already begun to inhabit.

> Out: *I trust what is given*
