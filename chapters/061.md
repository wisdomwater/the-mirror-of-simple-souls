## Day 61 — The Freedom of the Unburdened Soul

> When you become nothing in yourself, you begin to move in the quiet fullness of Love.

The soul comes to see her own smallness with a strange and peaceful clarity. She discovers that she cannot truly grasp herself, nor fully know another, nor comprehend the vastness of God. Everything she once thought she could hold slips gently beyond her reach. In this realization, she falls into a deep certainty—not of knowledge, but of not-knowing; not of strength, but of not-availing; not of effort, but of not-willing.

And in this nothingness, she is given everything.

Love says that this “naught” becomes her true name, the place where she lives and moves. It is not emptiness in the way she once feared. It is a quiet country of sufficiency and peace. There she floats as if carried by a calm sea, not stirred by inner striving or outward effort. Nothing weighs on her, not even the good things she does. Her actions pass through her like light through clear glass. She does not cling to them or measure them, for all has been given freely in the One who is all.

She no longer lives by doubt or by anxious trust. Instead, a gentle confidence arises—an agreement of her heart with the divine ordering. She wants only what Love wants, and this desire brings a freedom deeper than anything she has known.

Her old name fades. She is turned entirely toward Love, and yet there is still something higher waiting, known only by those whom Love has drawn into its secret.
