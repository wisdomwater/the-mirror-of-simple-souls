## Day 16 — Having All, Having Nothing

> *There is a freedom that comes when the soul rests inside what it cannot manage or foresee.*

Love speaks again of the soul who has been set free from inward strain. Such a soul meets adversity and prosperity the same way—not because she prefers either, but because neither begins in her will. She no longer tries to trace outcomes or decipher reasons. She does not know where her own salvation will be found, nor how mercy and justice will be woven for others. These questions are released into a wisdom larger than her reach. What remains is a quiet consent: to will only what God wills, and to endure that willing in peace.

Reason presses on, unsettled by the paradox. How can the soul be said to have everything and nothing at once? Love answers simply. Whoever has God has all. Yet whatever the soul possesses of God feels like nothing compared to what God is in God. The gift within her does not compete with the fullness beyond her. What she holds is real, but it does not satisfy her longing, because her love is turned toward the inexhaustible life that God keeps within himself.

And so the soul knows and does not know. She knows by faith that God is power, wisdom, and goodness beyond measure. She trusts the mystery of God-with-us, joined to human life and still offered as living presence. Yet she does not know in the way possession demands. Her knowing does not close around truth; it opens into it.

Here, faith becomes contemplation. Not effortful thought, but a dwelling. The soul remains held in what she cannot finish understanding, and finds herself strangely at rest there.
