## Day 65 — When Reason Falls Silent

> Love begins to speak clearly only when Reason grows quiet.

The soul discovers a strange inheritance: she is not merely a servant of virtue, but its lady. She is daughter of the divine, sister to wisdom, and spouse of Love itself. These words trouble Reason, for they seem too bold, too high, too free. Reason trembles before such speech and begins to fade, unable to stand in the presence of this union.

But the soul does not mourn this passing. She sees that as long as Reason ruled, she could not enter fully into her inheritance. Reason always measured, compared, and held her back with careful calculations. Now Love has spoken a deeper truth, and Reason falls silent under its weight.

In that stillness, Love begins to ask new questions—not about effort or achievement, but about origin. Where do virtues come from? What is their mother? The answer is not a list of good works or moral efforts. It is meekness.

Yet this meekness is not the gentle behavior learned through discipline or practice. It is something deeper, older, and more mysterious. It does not come from effort, but from the very heart of the divine. It is born of the majesty of God, a quiet root from which all virtues grow.

This meekness cannot be fully spoken of. Words falter near it. It is the soft ground from which peace rises, the hidden source that frees the soul from striving, and draws her into the stillness where Love alone remains.

> Out: *I rest in your meekness*
