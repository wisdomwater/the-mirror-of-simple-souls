## Day 74 — The Book Love Opens

> *When love opens its book, the soul discovers that nothing is missing, and nothing is her own.*

The soul who has come into this clear state no longer seeks God. There is nothing left to search for, because the Beloved has not withheld anything. He is already present. She has him. And if he does not hide himself, why should she wander looking elsewhere?

She begins to see that her Beloved lacks nothing. So why should she feel herself lacking? To desire something apart from him would be to turn again toward herself. But since he is full, she is full. Since he seeks nothing, she has nothing to seek. Since he rests, she rests. The love of herself quietly dissolves, and in its place she receives him without distance or resistance.

Love opens a book within her, and at that opening she knows all she needs to know. Not as knowledge of the mind, but as a quiet fullness. In that light, she returns to God what belongs to him and keeps only what is truly hers.

And what is hers is a simple nothingness. She sees that all being comes from him, and that she herself is not the source. In this discovery, she releases the burden of being someone apart from him.

So she dwells in the truth written in the book of life: all is from his bounty, and she is held within it, without needing to claim anything as her own.

> In: *Open your book within me*

> Out: *Let me rest in nothing*
