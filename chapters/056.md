## Day 56 — Without Shame or Glory

> When the soul is emptied of herself, even her story becomes God’s alone.

The soul remembers those whom God lifted in strange and beautiful ways—Magdalen, Peter, John—and wonders what became of their shame or their glory. Did they cling to what had happened to them? Did they defend themselves, or boast of what God had done through them?

No. They were free of themselves. What had been done in them belonged to God alone. Their sins were known, their gifts were known, yet they carried neither shame nor pride. They had nothing to prove and nothing to protect. All was left in the hands of the One who had worked in them.

And God has not grown weary of giving. His bounty has not ended with those saints of old. There are gifts still unspoken, still unimagined, waiting in the depths of his love. Nothing has been exhausted. The well has not run dry.

But the soul who longs for peace must remain gentle and ready. Love sends its messages in quiet ways, sometimes through hardship, sometimes through grace, sometimes through the soft pressure of an inward call. If the soul refuses these movements out of fear or distrust, she may find herself restless and burdened again with herself.

For love is most faithful when the need is greatest. It comes then, not to accuse, but to help. And the soul who trusts this help finds her peace kept safely in the hands of God.
